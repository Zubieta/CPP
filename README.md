## Algorithms in C++, Go, Perl, and Python
These are codes I made mostly in 2011 and 2012 (When I was most active in Competitive Programming), and from time to time since, as solutions to Algorithms problems from several different online judges, competitions, books, or simply as a hobby, made in **C++**, **Go**, **Perl** and **Python** (and maybe other languages I'm playing/working with at the moment). These are here as some sort of backup but also for educational purposes. The old codes have very cryptic variable names, bad spacing and are not commented, back then I didn't value the advantages of doing such thing, but hey, we're here to learn! With years I've gotten *slightly* more organized while coding, I hope that my current code is much more readable than those old files when I just started to learn programming.
