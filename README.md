##Competitive Programming in C++
These are codes I made mostly in 2011 and 2012 (When I was most active in this kind of stuff) and now again in 2014, as solutions to Competitive Programming problems from several different online judges, competitions, books, or simply as a hobby, made in **C++**, my favorite language for this kind of thing. These are here as some sort of backup but also for educational purposes. The old codes have very cryptic variable names, improper spacing and are not commented, back then I didn't value the advantages of doing such thing, but hey, we're here to learn! These are licensed for use under the **MIT License**.
