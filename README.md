##Algorithms in C++, Go and Python
These are codes I made mostly in 2011 and 2012 (When I was most active in Competitive Programming), and from time to time since, as solutions to Algorithms problems from several different online judges, competitions, books, or simply as a hobby, made in **C++**, **Go** and **Python**. These are here as some sort of backup but also for educational purposes. The old codes have very cryptic variable names, improper spacing and are not commented, back then I didn't value the advantages of doing such thing, but hey, we're here to learn! I hope that my current code is much more readable than those old files when I just started to learn programming. These are licensed for use under the **MIT License**.
