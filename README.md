## Algorithms

These are codes I made mostly in **2011** and **2012** _(When I was most active in Competitive Programming)_, and from time to time ever since, as solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems from several different online judges, competitions, books, or simply as a hobby, made in **C++**, **Go**, **Perl** and **Python** _(and maybe other languages I'm playing/working with at the moment)_.

The old codes from ten years ago have very cryptic variable names, bad spacing and are not properly commented, back then I know about the value of doing such thing, but across the years of studying and working my coding practices have improved significantly.

With years I've gotten more **organized** while coding, seeking to make it easier for others to understand my code. I believe that my current code is much more readable than those old files when I just started to learn programming.
