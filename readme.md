##Competitive Programming in C++
These are codes I made in 2011 (When I was most active in this kind of stuff) and now again in 2014, as solutions to Competitive Programming problems from several different online judges, competitions or books. These are here as some sort of backup but also for educational purposes (The old codes have very cryptic variable names and are not commented, back then I didn't value the advantages of doing such thing). These are licensed for use under the MIT License, and I hope to dust off successfully!
